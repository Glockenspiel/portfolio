===================================

Unlike a nice mustachioed plumber who has faced several adventures to save a princess, the protagonist of Blue Bloke Turbo is a strange blue creature with short legs that needs to reach the portals scattered by the colorful and psychedelic maps to get out alive of this adventure. 

In addition to the portals, you need to collect coins to increase the score and be quick to break your own time records. 

If you are a fan of platform games and are looking for instant challenges, embark on this strange world inhabited by the mysterious blue creature.  


When you start the demo version of the game, a simple psychedelic interface is presented directly, without any explanation of the game's history. Simple enough, since in the main menu, the only two options are "Start the game" and "Exit". In phase selection, the only possible action is to change the level of difficulty. 

The 2D graphic features simple, colorful textures that go well with the proposal without major title ambitions. Scenarios seem empty and lifeless in the course of the challenges. No, there are no bizarre creatures or challenging enemies, making the game's obstacles the only true challenge of the adventure.

For those who are unfamiliar with the platform genre, forget it, Blue Bloke Turbo will not please you. The stages can be too challenging for those who do not have keyboard skills and can make the game a tedious experience in just a few minutes. On the other hand, more experienced players in games of the genre can spend a few minutes next to the strange blue protagonist. The soundtrack does not thrill, but it has 8-bit melodies, reminiscent of classic platform games.

The installation of the game flowed perfectly and the game is lightweight and could be a good option for those looking for a simple, fast and challenging game.

In case you are starting now with games of the platform genre, Blue Bloke Turbo is not the best alternative. Maybe it's better to look for some of the various classic Nintendo's mustache games, available right here in Baixaki.
